# Track my mileage 

## Description

Track my mileage was built using MVC framework Handlebars.js and allows the user to track thier running progression on their profile page. Having ran at a the NCAA Div 1 level and currently still running. I drew inpiration from my background in running to build a project that would align with my personal interests. The homepage displays see runs that are being logged in by all users so that an indiviual runner can draw inspiration from other users. While building this app, I developed my ability to use Chart.js to dynamically populate the runs logged in by the user. Some of the challenges that I faced 



## Installation

The webapp is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed via the following link. 


## Usage

The first thing displayed is the homepage where runs from all users are displayed as posts. To access a personal profile, click login on the top of the screen. From there, the user will be prompted to either sign into your account or sign up for a new account. Once the form is filled out, the user will be redirected to your personal profile. To log in a run, fill out the form on the profile page. Once that is filled in, and the user hit submit, the graph will change to reflect the run and a new journal entry will be added to the bottom of the page. To go back to the homepage. Click home at the top of the screen.
